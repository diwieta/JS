/* data types are categorised into two on the basis of how they are stored and how can be accessed from the memory */

//  Primitive : call by value, so the original datas memory reference is not given but infact copy is given and changes happen there.

/*  7 types : 
String, Number, Boolearn, null, undefined, Symbol, BigInt */

// JS dynamic type or static type?



// Reference (Non primitive)
